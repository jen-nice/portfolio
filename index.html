            Greenhouse Restoration for Hot Yam, Engineering Strategies and Practices, U of T <br>
The client wanted to restore an old greenhouse in order to grow food for an on-campus student kitchen that promotes sustainable, locally grown, healthy meals. Myself and a team of three other students were put in charge of restoring a greenhouse for a client at the University of Toronto. This design project was done over a period of four months. An on campus vegan kitchen at U of T was looking to grow some of their food in a greenhouse by restoring an existing greenhouse on campus. We had the task of coming up with the restoration plans and designs. The team went through a series of analysis from environmental to economical, conducted several client meetings to understand their needs and requirements all resulting in a Design Specification Document linked below.

OSCSS website <br>
I am an alumni of the Ontario Science Centre Science School where you can do a semester of Gr12 at the Ontario Science Centre. It’s an experience I feel very lucky to have had. Last year another alumni and I started the process of planning a reunion for all alumni. This website was created to be an information hub for that and other reunion events. Currently, it is still in development and will be revamped this summer into a dynamic one. I coded it from scratch using HTML/CSS programming languages with a sprinkle of Java. All the design was done to reflect the atmosphere and energy of the program.

Dance Dance Revolution, Digital Systems, U of T  <br>
An implementation of the popular game Dance Dance Revolution was built using hardware circuits. The whole game was coded in Verilog, which is a hardware description language. So the game was built using hardware and not software which has a higher level of difficulty which goes into designing hardware circuits. The ‘foot pads’ consists of piezoelectric(pressure) sensors that convert pressure to voltage and an Arduino (microprocessor which read the signals from the sensor) was interfaced with the DE2 FPGA board to bring the game to life. The project spanned three weeks and was challenging to do as every pixel on the screen had to be read and specified from memory. It was a very rewarding experience with tons of laughs at the end and yes ‘Shake it off’ was the top danced to song!
