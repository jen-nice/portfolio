    <a href="http://jencol.github.io/OSCSSALUMNI/"><img src="images/oscmainpage.jpg" alt="osc" width="170" height="250"/></a>
    <p>I am an alumni of the Ontario Science Centre Science School where you can do a semester of Gr12 at the Ontario Science Centre. It’s an experience I feel very lucky to have had. Last year, another alumni and I started the process of planning a reunion. This website was created to be an information hub for that and other events. Currently, it is still in development. I coded it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with Bootstrap. Having being recently updated it is more  interactive and mobile friendly. The website was designed to reflect the atmosphere and energy of the program. You can visit the website

   <p>My team members and I implemented a mapping application in C++ using EasyGL graphics library to display city information using data from OpenStreetMap
   <p>Key map features include</p>
   <ul>
            <li>  Display of natural features and points of interest in chosen city </li>
            <li>  Road and Highway name display</li>
            <li>  Zoom feature with different levels of detail</li>
            <li>  Buttons to toggle features on/off in display</li>
            <li>  Finds quickest path between two points of interest</li>
            <li>  Best path between several points (Travelling Salesman Problem particular solution)</li>
   </ul>

    <p>An implementation of the popular game Dance Dance Revolution was built entirely in hardware. The ‘dance mat’ consisted of piezoelectric(pressure) sensors that converted foot pressure to voltage and an Arduino board helped to read in dance moves and passed them on to the main controller (Altera DE2 board). The project spanned three weeks and was a challenging but very rewarding experience with tons of laughs at the end, and yes, ‘Shake it off’ was the top song choice!</p><br>

    <p></a>For this design project, our client wanted to restore an old greenhouse in order to grow food for a student kitchen that promoted healthy meals made out of local produce. My team had the task of coming up with the restoration plans and designs over a period of four months. We went through a series of analysis from environmental to economical, conducted several client meetings to understand their needs which finally resulted in a Design Specification Document.       </p>
