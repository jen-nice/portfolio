            <h2>Greenhouse Restoration Design Project, Engineering Strategies and Practices, U of T </h2><br>
For this design project, our client wanted to restore an old greenhouse in order to grow food for a student kitchen that promoted healthy meals made out of local produce. My team had the task of coming up with the restoration plans and designs over a period of four months. We went through a series of analysis from environmental to economical, conducted several client meetings to understand their needs which finally resulted in the Design Specification Document.This document has been emailed along with my application.

<h2>Ontario Science Centre Science School Almuni website</h2> <br>
I am an alumni of the Ontario Science Centre Science School where you can do a semester of Gr12 at the Ontario Science Centre. It’s an experience I feel very lucky to have had. Last year, another alumni and I started the process of planning a reunion. This website was created to be an information hub for that and other events. Currently, it is still in development and will be revamped this summer. I coded it from scratch using HTML/CSS programming languages with a sprinkle of Java. The website was designed to reflect the atmosphere and energy of the program. You can visit the website

<h2>Dance Dance Revolution, Digital Systems, U of T  </h2><br>

An implementation of the popular game Dance Dance Revolution was built entirely in hardware. The ‘dance mat’ consisted of piezoelectric(pressure) sensors that converted foot pressure to voltage and an Arduino board helped to read in dance moves and passed them on to the main controller (Altera DE2 board). The project spanned three weeks and was a challenging but very rewarding experience with tons of laughs at the end, and yes, ‘Shake it off’ was the top song choice! Take a look at the video below.<br>
